            Hi I&#39;m Jared Malvic and I am training to become a full stack web developer based on Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a background in material science and engineering from Ohio State. Although I learned critical thinking and data analysis
            from my time there, I found it didn&#39;t allow much room for the creative thinking that I naturally excel at.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have nearly four years of experience in the steel industry at Worthington Industries where I collaborated with a team
            to collect data to meet an hourly deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal today is to combine the skills I learned at Worthington with the skills I learned at Ohio State and apply them to
            becoming a successful member of a web development team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now hold on. This isn&#39;t as bad as it seems. I just need to relax and be myself. I'm not so bad, right? Right?
        </p>
